Thoughts on getting each plant on a cycle

Water: 
Keep Moist - every 4 days
Top 1/3 - every 7 days
Top 1/2 - every 10 days
Dry Out - every 14 days

Humidity: 
Extreme - every 2 days
High - every 5 days
Moderate - every 10 days
Low - Never

If (humidity === "extreme"){
    notify every x 2 days
} 
and so on.....


Thoughts: would it be easier to ask the user for a specific amount of days in between each activity?

Pros:
More accurate 
Might be easier to implement

Cons:
Might be complicated to set up


Next goals: Figure out time cycles for plants
